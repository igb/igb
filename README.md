You can follow me in the fediverse for hot takes, bad jokes, and bird photos at [@igb@mastodon.hccp.org](https://mastodon.hccp.org/@igb).

I'm still on Twitter as [@igb](https://twitter.com/igb), but I only post things there to help it burn faster.

You can also check out my [blog](https://www.hccp.org/blog.html). I add a new post there every four years or so.
